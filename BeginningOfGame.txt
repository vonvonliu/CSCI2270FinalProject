You hear a loud noise. ‘Meow!!’ In fear, you wake up to another sound coming from the backyard.
You look out your bedroom window and see three masked men shouting in a foreign language, one of them holding a tranquilizer gun shooting at your pet cheetah, Chase.
‘No!’ you scream. However, it was too late. They finesse him onto their van and begin to drive away, disappearing down the street.
What are you going to do? In front of your house, you find a contract with the order of “bring the beast to the East for fur making”.
In order to save your best friend, Chase, you must travel to Asia and get him back!
