After having travelled all of the countries in Asia,
in your final country, you finally spot Chase! With the help of the
local police, you are able to successfully get your
beloved cheetah back. Now, Chase will be safe in your arms.
Congratulations on finishing our game! We hope that you have
learned a lot during your journey!
